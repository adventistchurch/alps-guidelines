## Design System Benefits
Explain how the design system benefits users and the business. For inspiration, check out over 180 examples of design systems at [Styleguides.io](http://styleguides.io/examples).

## App Gallery
It can be a good idea to include a <a href="{{ "/gallery.html" | prepend: site.baseurl }}">list of applications</a> that use the design system. This helps provide credibility to the system, incentivizes teams to use the system, and shows components in the wild.

## Contributing info
If it's desirable to have people from across the organization contribute to the design system, linking to the <a href="{{ "/contributing.html" | prepend: site.baseurl }}">contributing page</a> from the homepage could be a good idea.
