## Welcome to the Adventist Living Pattern System

We are glad you found ALPS. Take a look around, and see what you think. There is lots to explore. You can find the code on [Github](https://github.com/adventistchurch/alps), check it out, [file issues](https://github.com/adventistchurch/alps/issues), and create pull requests. This code belongs to the Adventist church. Itâ€™s ours!

The Adventist Living Pattern System (ALPS) is a set of design patterns created by the Seventh-day Adventist Church for use around the world by Adventist churches, schools, and organizational units. The purpose of ALPS is to make it easy for our church to create good looking sites that promote the brand of the church, while allowing for individuality and customization of each site.

As you browse through the pages of this site, you will see examples of patterns for different types of pages. From [home pages](/templates/home) to [channel pages](/templates/channel-main), to [basic pages](/templates/basic-page), ALPS is designed to be beautiful, fast and flexible, while maintaining a consistent brand across the sites that use it.

Take a look for yourself!
